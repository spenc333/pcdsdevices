class UnrelatedComponent(Component):
    """
    Components that are unrelated to the main ``prefix`` attribute.

    These components each need to have a full prefix specified rather than
    the normal ``suffix`` extension or formatting. This is specified in the
    device's ``**kwargs``, e.g. ``subdevice_prefix='SOME:PV'``.

    The `collect_prefixes` class method is used to gather these special
    prefixes in a convenient one-liner rather than needing to sift through
    formatted components.

    Examples
    --------

    A simple usage example::

        from pcdsdevices.device import UnrelatedComponent as UCpt

        class MyDevice(Device):

    This exists as a convenience tool for one-off devices that need to include
    other pre-instantiated devices as elements.

    .. note::

        Since this picks an object to include at class definition time,

    Parameters
    ----------
    obj : object
        Any existing object. This will be included in the Device as a proper
        component, as if it was constructed by the class itself.

    kind : `ophydobj.Kind` or str, optional
        If provided, override the object's kind. In standard components this
        defaults to Kind.normal, but here it will default to "do not change

    A device that is a group of components that will act independently.

    This has the following implications:
    - Components will have no references to this parent device. If
      accessed and used out of context, the components will be as if
      they were instantited completely separately.
    - The parent device will be stashed in the ``biological_parent``
      attribute, in case it's needed (by something other than the RE)
    - If a component is staged in a bluesky plan, it will not stage
      the ``GroupDevice``, and therefore will not stage the entire
      device tree.
    - ``GroupDevice`` instances by default do nothing when staged.
      You can add specific subdevices to the stage list by setting the
      ``stage_group`` class attribute to a list of components.
    - Following from the previous point, note that ``GroupDevice``
      instances cannot process top-level ``stage_sigs``. If you need
      top-level ``stage_sigs``, you should instead contain them in a
      subdevice that is not a ``GroupDevice``.
    - ``GroupDevice`` instances that implement ``set`` are required
      to specify a ``stage_group`` to help remind you that these classes
      really do need to stage "something" before scanning. If your
      movable device really does not need this, you can set ``stage_group``
      to an empty list.
    - When represented in typhos, we'll see the ``GroupDevice`` screen
      instead of the default device screens.
      (Note: at time of writing, this hypothetical ``GroupDevice``
      ui template does not yet exist).
    - Certain devices will completely break if we remove their subdevice
      references: for example, consider the ``PsuedoPositioner`` class.
      For classes like these, we'll need to keep the parent references
      for the ``PseudoSingle`` instances. For the full list of classes that
